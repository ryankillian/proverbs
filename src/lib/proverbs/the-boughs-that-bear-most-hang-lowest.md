1655 Fuller Church Hist. X iii, III 231: His humility set a lustre
on all, (admirable that the whole should be so low, whose several

branches. 1732 Ful., no. 4430.

### Literal Meaning

The proverb "The Boughs that bear most hang lowest" depicts a natural phenomenon observed in fruit-bearing trees. Boughs or branches that are laden with a substantial amount of fruit tend to droop or hang lower than those without fruit, due to the weight they carry. This imagery serves as a straightforward metaphor for a deeper message about humility and the characteristics of individuals who carry significant knowledge or wisdom.

### Humility and Knowledge

The proverb conveys an ethical lesson on humility. Just as the boughs heavy with fruit bend down, individuals who possess great knowledge, wisdom, or accomplishments often exhibit humility. The weight of their virtues or achievements grounds them, making them more humble and accessible, as opposed to those who might boast without substance.

### The Weight of Responsibility

Another layer of meaning in this proverb is the notion that with greater knowledge or success comes greater responsibility. The heaviness of the boughs represents the burdens and responsibilities that accompany significant achievements. This weight requires one to stay grounded and balanced, metaphorically bowing under the pressure of their duties and roles.

### Contrast Between Appearance and Substance

The proverb subtly contrasts appearance with substance. Boughs without fruit might appear upright and prominent, but this is due to their lack of substance. Similarly, people who appear boastful or proud might do so because they lack the weight of true achievement or knowledge. This highlights the deceptive nature of appearances and the importance of looking beyond the surface to understand true value and merit.

### Reflection on Personal Growth

The imagery of the hanging boughs can also be a reflection on personal growth and maturity. Just as a tree grows and its branches bear fruit over time, individuals develop and mature, accumulating experiences and wisdom. The more one grows and learns, the more one realizes the importance of humility and the value of lowering oneself in service to others.

### Connection to Historical Context

The references to the works of Fuller in 1655 and 1732 reinforce the timeless nature of this wisdom. Fuller's observation of humility as an "admirable" trait likens it to a tree laden with fruit, underscoring the virtue of humility throughout history. This historical context enriches the proverb, suggesting that such wisdom has been recognized and valued across generations.

### Implications for Leadership

In a broader societal context, this proverb can be applied to leadership. Effective leaders often display humility, acknowledging their responsibilities and the contributions of others. Just as the boughs support the fruit, good leaders support their teams and communities, bowing under the weight of their responsibilities rather than seeking to elevate themselves unduly.

### The Interplay of Strength and Humility

A profound insight from the proverb is the interplay between strength and humility. The strength of the boughs is not diminished by their bending; rather, their ability to bear fruit and sustain weight showcases their resilience. Similarly, true strength in individuals is shown through their capacity to remain humble and grounded despite their achievements.

### Concluding Thoughts

The proverb "The Boughs that bear most hang lowest" encapsulates a rich tapestry of meanings, from literal observations in nature to profound ethical teachings on humility, responsibility, and true strength. It invites contemplation on personal growth, the nature of knowledge, and the virtues of effective leadership, illustrating how ancient wisdom continues to resonate in contemporary contexts.
