The Elizabethan proverb "Be jogging while your Boots are green" offers a rich tapestry of meanings, both literal and metaphorical.

**Literal Meaning:**
On the surface, the proverb uses imagery from everyday life during the Elizabethan era—jogging, or moving along, and green boots, which typically signify new or unused leather boots. Literally, it suggests continuing one’s journey while the boots are still new or in good condition.

**Ethical Advice:**
The ethical layer of this proverb advocates for proactive and timely action. It suggests that one should take advantage of opportunities and favorable conditions while they still exist. Essentially, it advises acting decisively and quickly before circumstances change.

**Subtle, Hidden or Non-Obvious Insights:**
Delving deeper, the mention of "green" boots may subtly point towards youth and the early stages of an endeavor when energy and resources are abundant but perhaps underutilized. This interpretation guides the advice towards making the most out of one's 'youthful' vigor or early moments of any projects or phases of life.

**Subtle Complexities:**
The use of the word "jogging" rather than running or walking introduces a complexity to the proverb. Jogging is steady but not hurried, suggesting a balanced approach to taking action—be steady and persistent but not necessarily rushing, allowing one to sustain effort over a longer period.

**Profound Embedded Knowledge:**
Embedded within this proverb is the recognition of the ephemeral nature of optimal conditions. The wisdom here is profound in its understanding of the temporal nature of life’s stages and opportunities. It hints at the inevitability of wear and decay—like boots that will eventually cease to be green—implying that timing is crucial in the utilization of any resource or opportunity.

**Insights After Deep Contemplation:**
Upon deeper reflection, the proverb transcends the immediate context of physical movement and condition of attire. It becomes a metaphor for the human condition and the passage of time. It calls upon the listener to consider the broader implications of their actions within the limited span of favorable conditions, encouraging a mindfulness about the transient nature of life’s stages, urging one to act while conditions are still favorable.

Through this exploration, the proverb proves to be not only a simple piece of advice for practical life but also a deeper philosophical statement about making the most of the ephemeral nature of life’s opportunities.
